Advent of Code 2018 solutions on Sketch

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

[Sketch.sh](https://sketch.sh/) is a platform for sharing runnable ReasonML and OCaml completely in your browser. 

For promoting Sketch.sh and ReasonML in general, I created this repository so everyone can add their solution and compare it with each others. 

[@fstiffo](https://sketch.sh/u/fstiffo) solved last year Advent of Code entirely on Sketch. And you can take inspiration from [his account](https://sketch.sh/u/fstiffo)


Please send a PR to update this README with your Sketch link.
